                <h3 className="aboutHeading">Issue</h3>
                    <p>
                        Have you ever felt pity for your living conditions? ever felt hopelessly helpless for no one
                        really cares about your condition? or maybe, ever been at that bliss close to losing meaning to
                        your own life? If yes, then you were living the life of many young children in my country
                        today, Rwanda.<br />
                        Reference from UNICEF May, 2021 report, it is estimated that there are about 7,000 street
                        children around the country while close to 300,000 live in families where a minor is the head
                        of the household. <br />
                        In big cities like Kigali, Rubavu, and Musanze among others, it is even worse, since around
                        3000 of them are young girls aged below 15years. <br />
                        In fact, the 7000 in Rwanda have endlessly suffered a life without a hope for a better
                        tomorrow, but just struggles for survival; no school, no clothes, no sanitaries or even other
                        essentials of life like shelter. <br />
                        In this analysis, I will use the records of Street Bridge Foundation, a newly formed
                        non-governmental youth led initiative mandated to addressing the street kids’ challenges, and
                        as well as the City of Kigali as a case study to explore a plethora of long term sustainable and
                        non-retributive solutions to addressing the issue in concern; while protecting the interests of
                        all the problem stakeholders as well. 
                    </p>
                <h3 className="aboutHeading">Analysis</h3>
                    <p>
                        In 2015, President Paul Kagame raised alarm upon the issue. Undoubtedly, the city
                        authorities together with the security officials responded by dentaining them (street kids), and
                        taking them to transit centres among other cruel techniques of ‘cleaning the streets’, a famous
                        slogan in those days. However, it still yielded nothing at the end of the day, since the trend
                        still increased by 23% per annum till todate. <br />
                        With that failure, Non-governmental organisations like UNICEF, Save The Children, and
                        many more others were invited to engage the issue but all in vain. <br />
                        For instance, at Groupe Scholaire Nyanza, a primary and lower secondary school at
                        Nyanza-Kicukiro, more than 200 street kids were waived school tuition fees by MINEDUC.
                        But surprisingly enough, these kids would go study, then after school, return back to the
                        streets for company and shelter; a standard that’s not long term sustainable, since around 80%
                        of them eventually dropped out back to the streets again. <br />
                        What does this mean? It portrays to us that despite the government’s and other
                        non-governmental organisations’ efforts to address the issue in concern, the problem was, and
                        is still persistent, since only its symptoms are looked unto, but it causes ignored.
                        In fact, the question shouldn’t be whether we are losing our future generations on the streets
                        or not, but rather, why they are going there. This calls for a fastidious attention on the realm
                        cause of the issue, not the effects of the issue. <br />
                        Come to think of it, many street kids have families, and while taking a decision to leave their
                        families and go to the street should be seen as a strong psychological decision, it's still our
                        role as the future change makers to highlight the conscious reasons behind that decision.
                        According to the Street Bridge Foundation’s report in December 2021; Erick Sebagabo was
                        examined why he was on the street but responded by stressing on domestic problems; His
                        mom was a prostitute, and his father was a drunkee, a combination of every night beatings
                        and autrocities that he wouldn’t sustain. There was no food at home, no clothes, in fact, no
                        life at all , since none of his parents were willing to sustain one. Come to think of it, Erick’s
                        story is similar to many other street kids like him. It shades light to us that, even though
                        school tuition was to be paid, it doesn’t stop the domestic violence, hunger and other family
                        problems which a kid is seeking refuge from.

                <h3 className="aboutHeading">Proposal</h3>
                    <p>
                        From our four community-based projects done so far, Street Bride Foundation has gone a
                        significant step in providing a long and sustainable solution to addressing the issue.
                        We have embarked to not only solve the symptoms, but also the very core causes of the
                        problem. We engage Street Kids at the grass root level of the street, they share their own side
                        of the stories, we show them love, empathy, care and even belonging; but also go an extra
                        mile to connecting with their parents, family or even guardians at home. <br />
                        We share with them constructive ideas, highlight the cause of the issue, and even mandate
                        helping the kid with the direct responsibility and consent of his or her parents. <br />
                        In most cases, while parents are willing to work with us in the development and
                        transformational journey of the kid, they are sometimes affected by household unsound
                        finance. But through collection campaigns and fundraising events, we hope to expand and set
                        up some small revenue streams for them, like small shops, some animals to rare etc.
                        With that source of income, we believe they will be able to sustain life at home, food security,
                        and even help us to help the kid in his or her next journey of transformation. <br />
                        But as a foundation, that's not enough. We do believe that that kid still needs your help,
                        guidance and even company through the trajectory of change. Thus, we take an extra mile to
                        make regular follow ups so as to highlight the degree of impact, and how further to help the
                        kid develop in life. <br />
                        In some special cases, kids aren’t able to go back home. It is our role then, to struggle with
                        getting host families to help adopt the kid, and further support him or her in life.
                        However, for now, the impacts observed are still very small scale since the foundation’s
                        economy is unsound without any source of revenue, but mere high school students who make
                        its composition. <br />
                        With a sound and stable source of revenue, we believe the impacts will be magnified from
                        helping just twenty kids a year, to maybe one thousand, or even more.

                <h3 className="aboutHeading">Further Questions</h3>
                        This analysis only covers the causes of increasing trends of street kids and associated social
                        ills, along with the possible alternatives as referred from the report by Street Bridge
                        Foundation. However, there are additional components not thoroughly explored in this paper
                        that require further study, care, and fastidious attention: <br />
                        Gender based violence: While this analysis examines more of the outer surface family
                        problems like prostitution, alcoholism and finance that make kids join to the streets, it should
                        also be noted that to a significant magnitude, gender based violence of young girls either by
                        their parents or elders family members can also fuel their thoughs to joining streets. <br />
                        This however, is less attended to, as it raises little or even no alarm at all; just like the street
                        kids who are raped, or subjected to other forms of gender based violence as well. <br />
                        Drug abuse: Most street kids, if not all of them, usually find comfort in drugs. You will find
                        them from morning to evening collecting valuable items like scrap, thrown charcoal etc. The
                        picked items are then sold to the market sellers at an extra cheap cost, and the little penny got
                        is taken into drugs like Kush, Cigar, and even glue. <br />
                        Although it is justified that these are to make them less concentrated on their life struggles, it
                        should be noted that it instead kills them slowly rather than healing them.
                        Additionally to weakening their immune systems, it even affects their transformational
                        compatibility in a drug free society. But I believe the people selling those drugs are more
                        dangerous than the drugs themselves. <br />
                        Involvement of the state. The proposal part of this analysis focuses on the role played by the
                        Street Bridge Foundation. However, the foundation alone can't manage the whole thing, free
                        of state partnership and cooperation. With the state involvement: Rwanda National Police,
                        National Institute of Statistics, MINICOFIN etc, We think it would help Street Bridge and
                        maybe, other organisations with similar motives to emerge, get access to information, man
                        power, finincial resources and even other tools necessary for grown and sustainable
                        innovative solutions to addressing the issue in concern.
